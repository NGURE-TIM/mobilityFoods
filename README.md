Kenyan Spice is a delightful recipe app that introduces you to the rich and diverse flavors of Kenyan cuisine. With a simple yet elegant design, this app is not just about cooking; it's a showcase of the true power of Flutter. Inspired by the Flutter course by Dr. Angela Yu at the App Brewery, this app represents two months of dedicated work and serves as a significant milestone in my journey as a mobile and software engineer.
